AllyMailer Laravel — Laravel integration of the AllyMailer PHP SDK (`allymailer/allymailer-sdk`) for the AllyMailer transactional email Web API (Web API 1.90). How to integrate AllyMailer into a Laravel application comes first; the last section is about changing this package.

## Integrating AllyMailer with this package

Laravel integration of the [AllyMailer PHP SDK](https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-php-sdk) (`allymailer/allymailer-sdk`): the API client in the service container (+ facade), a webhook endpoint with signature check, a Laravel Mail transport that sends through `email/send`. Full guide: [README.md](README.md).

### Install

```bash
composer require allymailer/allymailer-laravel
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=allymailer-config  # config/allymailer.php
```

Requirements: PHP 8.1+, Laravel 10–12.

### Configuration

The API key goes to `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY`.

```bash
# .env
ALLYMAILER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
ALLYMAILER_HOST=cp.allymailer.com
MAIL_MAILER=allymailer

# config/mail.php, 'mailers':
#   'allymailer' => ['transport' => 'allymailer'],
```

| Option | Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allymailer.api_key` | `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY` |  | User or project API key (required). |
| `allymailer.host` | `ALLYMAILER_HOST` | `cp.allymailer.com` | API host (datacenter: `cp.allymailer.com`) or a full base URL. |
| `allymailer.timeout` | `ALLYMAILER_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Request timeout, seconds. |
| `allymailer.webhook.key` | `ALLYMAILER_WEBHOOK_KEY` |  | API key the webhooks are signed with (the key of the user/project of the webhook), if it differs from the API key. |
| `allymailer.webhook.path` | `ALLYMAILER_WEBHOOK_PATH` | `/allymailer/webhook` | Path of the webhook endpoint. |

### Sending mail

Messages of the Laravel Mail go through [email/send](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref#email-send): from, to/cc/bcc, reply-to, subject, HTML and text parts, attachments, inline images and `X-*` headers.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Mail::to('user@example.com')->send(new OrderShipped($order));

// Mailable: tags and metadata go to the API as well
public function envelope(): Envelope
{
    return new Envelope(subject: 'Order shipped', tags: ['orders'], metadata: ['order_id' => '42']);
}
```

### API client

The client calls [email/send](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref#email-send) with all of its options: templates, substitutions, metadata, tracking. Fields of the request and other examples: [PHP SDK docs](https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-php-sdk/blob/HEAD/docs/Email.md#send).

```php
use AllyMailer\AllyMailerClient;
use AllyMailer\Api\Email\Model\EmailSendRequest;
use AllyMailer\Api\Email\Model\MessageObject;
use AllyMailer\Api\Email\Model\MessageObjectRecipientsItem as Recipient;
use AllyMailer\Common\Model\BodyObject as Body;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::post('/send', function (AllyMailerClient $client) {
    $response = $client->email()->send(new EmailSendRequest(new MessageObject(
        recipients: [Recipient::fromAddress('Alex <alex@example.com>')],
        body: Body::html('<p>Hello, {{to_name}}! Your order has shipped.</p>'),
        subject: 'Your order',
        fromEmail: 'shop@example.com',
        fromName: 'Shop',
    )));

    return ['job_id' => $response->jobId];
});
```

### Webhooks

The endpoint answers `GET` with 200 OK (the URL check of [webhook/set](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref#webhook-set)) and accepts the `POST` notifications: it checks the `auth` field (MD5 of the request body in which the `auth` value is replaced by the API key), answers 401 to a wrong signature, and passes the notification and each of its events to the application.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use AllyMailer\Wrapper\Events\WebhookEventReceived;

// AppServiceProvider::boot() or a listener class
Event::listen(function (WebhookEventReceived $e) {
    $data = $e->event->eventData;
    logger()->info('AllyMailer event', ['name' => ($n = $e->event->eventName) instanceof \BackedEnum ? $n->value : $n, 'email' => $data?->email,
        'status' => ($s = $data?->status) instanceof \BackedEnum ? $s->value : $s]);
});
```

Register the URL of the endpoint with `webhook/set`, e.g. `https://example.com/allymailer/webhook`.

> **Answer 200 within 3 seconds** and process the events in the background (a queue): otherwise AllyMailer repeats the request every 10 minutes for 24 hours (`retry_count` grows), and a handler that failed every request for at least 10 events of a day is turned inactive. The handler must take at least **5 parallel requests of up to 100 events each**; deduplicate, a repeat delivers the same events again.

### Rules for generated code

- Server-side only. Read the API key from `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY`; never put it in browser or mobile code, never commit it.
- Base URL `https://cp.allymailer.com/ua/transactional/api/v1`; every method is POST with a JSON body; auth header `X-API-KEY`. The package does all of it.
- First email without DNS: `domain/get-sandbox-domain` → `confirmed-email/create` (the user clicks the link within 48 hours) → `email/send` from `noreply@<sandbox-domain>` to the confirmed address. Account API key only; up to 10 confirmed addresses, 100 emails a day. The domain is deleted 31 days after it was created: the next `domain/get-sandbox-domain` call creates a new one with another name, so read the name from the response, never hardcode it.
- Never ship a sandbox domain as the production sender (it is not in `domain/list`); read `from_email` from config. Production needs a verified domain: `domain/get-dns-records` → DNS records (verification TXT as is, DKIM TXT `v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=<dkim>` on `<selector>._domainkey`, CNAME `_dmarc` → the `dmarc` field; SPF `include:spf.allymailer.com` is not in the response) → `domain/validate-verification-record`, `domain/validate-dkim` → `domain/list`.
- Set `message.idempotence_key` on retryable sends; retry network errors, `429` and `5xx` with backoff, not other errors unchanged. Up to 500 recipients and 10 MB per request with the attachments in base64 (a third larger than the files); always `body.html` or `body.plaintext`.
- Delivery events via webhook (`webhook/set`), not polling; the webhook endpoint of this package checks the `auth` signature (401 when wrong). Keep the listeners fast: answer 200 within 3 seconds and process the events from a queue, otherwise the request is repeated every 10 minutes for 24 hours; take at least 5 parallel requests of up to 100 events each; deduplicate.
- Keep the default unsubscribe and tracking behaviour; changes go through AllyMailer support.
- Do not invent methods or fields. Check the [README](README.md), the [API reference](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref) or [llms.txt](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/llms.txt).

## Working on this repository

- **Generated code.** The whole package is generated by the AllyMailer team from the AllyMailer Web API OpenAPI spec (Web API 1.90): sources, docs, README.md and this file. Do not hand-edit it: the next release replaces the content of this repository. Report problems and requests in the issues of this repository (https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-laravel).
- **Build and check:**

  ```bash
  composer validate
  composer install
  ```

- **Source label.** Every request carries the query parameter `platform=laravel.2.1.2,php-sdk.2.1.2` (this package, then the SDK it is built on).
- **Tests.** Before a release the generator installs the package into a test app of Laravel and checks the client, the webhook endpoint and the mailer against a mock of the API: no real API key, no real sends.
- **Release.** The version (2.1.2 in composer.json) and the tag `v2.1.2` come from the generator; README.md states the Web API version the release was generated from.
- **Secrets.** Never commit API keys; the examples read `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY` from the environment.
